# Intro
The purpose of this repo is to create structure towards learning leetcode style problems. I am assuming that you are in the industry for a while and want to break through the leetcode barrier either to find better jobs or to gain that extra confidence in yourself. 

# Getting Started

## Sign up for leetcode
Sign up here: https://leetcode.com/accounts/signup/

## Run the jupyter notebook locally
If you want to follow along, this repo has python notebooks. To run the notebooks locally:
* `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
* Source your venv by running source `./bin/activate`
* Then just run `jupyter notebook` - it will open a browser tab with your interactive notebook
